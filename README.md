# Reddit-Client

## Project Overview
### The Reddit API provides data which you will integrate into your application. The application will allow users to view and search posts and comments provided by the API. 

## Project Requirements
* Build the application using React and Redux - I've chosen context instead! 
* Version control your application with Git and host the repository on GitHub 
* Use a project management tool (GitHub Projects, Trello, etc.) to plan your work 
* Write a README (using Markdown) that documents your project including:
    * Wireframes
    * Technologies used
    * Features
    * Future work
* Write unit tests for your components using Jest and Enzyme 
* Write end-to-end tests for your application 
* Users can use the application on any device (desktop to mobile) 
* Users can use the application on any modern browser 
* Users can access your application at a URL 
* Users see an initial view of the data when first visiting the app 
* Users can search the data using terms 
* Users can filter the data based on categories that are predefined 
* Users are shown a detailed view (modal or new page/route) when they select an item 
* Users are delighted with a cohesive design system 
* Users are delighted with animations and transitions 
* Users are able to leave an error state 
* Get 90+ scores on Lighthouse
    * We understand you cannot control how media assets like videos and images are sent to the client. It is okay to have a score below 90 for Performance if they are related to the media from Reddit.
* OPTIONAL: Get a custom domain name and use it for your application 
* OPTIONAL: Set up a CI/CD workflow to automatically deploy your application when the master branch in the repository changes 
* OPTIONAL: Make your application a progressive web app
